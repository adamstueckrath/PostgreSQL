HAVING Syntax 

SELECT column_1, aggregate_function(column_2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_1
HAVING condition;

The HAVING clause sets the condition for group rows created by the GROUP BY Clause after the GROUP BY clause applies while the WHERE clause sets the condition for individual rows before GROUP BY clause applies.

THis is the main difference between the HAVING and WHERE clauses.
